# NixieMega
Digital fluorescent tube lamp driver for AtMega processor in AVR.

## How does the program work?
To work, the program needs an ИH-4 (NH-4) type electron digitron and a MH74141 or K155ИД1 type driver.  
Optionally, we can connect the LCD screen and two buttons to control the speed of the lamp.
